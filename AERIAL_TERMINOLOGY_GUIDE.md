## 🤸‍♀️ Concept Explanations

### 1. **Static Tricks** 🧘‍♀️
**What it means:**
- Holding a pose/position
- Focus on strength and form
- Not moving between poses

**Examples:**
- Holding a thigh lock
- Staying in an inversion
- Balancing poses

**Who likes it:**
- Students who want to build strength
- People who prefer precision over flow
- Those working on specific poses

---

### 2. **Transitions** 🔄
**What it means:**
- **Movement BETWEEN poses** (not the poses themselves)
- How to smoothly enter, exit, or change positions
- Flow and fluidity

**Examples:**
- Getting into the fabric from standing
- Moving from foot lock → thigh lock
- Transitioning from upright → inverted
- Climbing up or down the fabric
- Dismounting techniques

**Who likes it:**
- Students who love flowing sequences
- People who want smooth, dance-like movements
- Those who find static holds boring

**Teaching tip:**
- If a tutorial focuses on "how to get into X pose" → tag it "Transitions"
- If it's about "holding X pose" → tag it "Static Tricks"

---

### 3. **Sequences** 🎬
**What it means:**
- Multiple poses connected together
- A choreographed combination
- Usually includes transitions + static moments

**Examples:**
- "3-Pose Flow Sequence"
- "Beginner Routine"
- Choreographed combinations

**Who likes it:**
- Students who want variety
- People preparing for performances
- Those who find single poses repetitive

**Difference from Transitions:**
- **Transitions:** Focus on the movement itself
- **Sequences:** Focus on the combination of multiple elements

---

### 4. **Inversions** 🙃
**What it means:**
- Being upside down
- Head below heart
- Requires core strength and confidence

**Examples:**
- Hip hang
- Inverted straddle
- Any pose where you're upside down

**Why it's a separate interest:**
- Not everyone likes/can do inversions
- Some people have medical restrictions
- Others LOVE the feeling of being upside down

**Safety note:**
- Requires proper progression
- Not for complete beginners
- Important to tag correctly!

---

### 5. **Drops** 🎢
**What it means:**
- Controlled falls from height
- Advanced technique
- Requires strength, technique, and confidence

**Examples:**
- Any move where you "drop" from one position to another
- Usually involves momentum and timing

**Why we ask about it in onboarding:**
- Very advanced - not suitable for beginners
- Some students are scared of drops (totally normal!)
- Others specifically seek them out
- Helps filter recommendations appropriately

---

## 🎯 How Interests Affect Recommendations

When users select interests in onboarding, the AI will:

1. **Prioritize matching collections**
   - If they like "Transitions" → recommend tutorials tagged with "Transitions"
   - If they like "Static Tricks" → recommend tutorials tagged with "Static"

2. **Respect preferences**
   - If they say "No" to drops → never recommend drop tutorials
   - If they select "Inversions" → include inverted poses

3. **Consider skill progression**
   - Won't recommend advanced moves to beginners
   - Considers both their stated level AND watch history

4. **Provide variety**
   - Mixes different collections they're interested in
   - Helps them explore related techniques
