## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: SUBSCRIPTION DECISION

You have **2 options** for subscriptions:

### Option 1: Launch FREE Tonight, Add Subscriptions in v1.1 (RECOMMENDED)
✅ **Pros:** Submit tonight, get approved faster, test market first  
✅ **Steps:** Submit as completely free app now, add subscriptions next week  
✅ **Timeline:** Live in 3-7 days, monetize in 2 weeks

### Option 2: Add Subscriptions Before Launch (Longer)
⏰ **Pros:** Monetize from day 1  
⏰ **Cons:** Need to implement subscription code first (~4-6 hours work)  
⏰ **Timeline:** Can't submit tonight, ready in 2-3 days

**MY RECOMMENDATION:** Launch free tonight (Option 1). Get users first, add subscriptions in v1.1 next week. This is what most successful apps do!
